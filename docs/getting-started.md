# Getting Started with Rules Manager

## Introduction
Rules Manager is a powerful business rules engine that transforms Excel-based business logic into RESTful APIs. It enables organizations to maintain their business rules in familiar Excel spreadsheets while exposing them as versioned API endpoints for seamless integration into applications.

## Key Benefits

### 1. Excel-Based Rule Definition
- Use familiar Excel formulas and functions
- No programming knowledge required for basic rules
- Leverage existing Excel-based business logic
- Quick validation and testing using Excel

### 2. API-First Integration
- RESTful API endpoints for all rules
- Versioned API support
- Automatic API documentation
- Easy integration with any application

### 3. Advanced Flow Capabilities
- Visual flow designer for complex rules
- Parallel execution paths
- Conditional branching
- Data transformation between nodes

### 4. Enterprise-Ready Features
- Version control for all rules
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging
- Performance monitoring

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a Rule Category
```bash
curl -X POST http://your-domain.com/api/categories \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Pricing Rules",
    "description": "Product pricing calculations"
  }'
```

### 2. Prepare Excel Rule File
1. Create a new Excel file
2. Define input cells with names starting with `IP_`
3. Define output cells with names starting with `OP_`
4. Add your business logic using Excel formulas

Example:
- `IP_basePrice`: Input cell for base price
- `IP_quantity`: Input cell for quantity
- `OP_totalPrice`: Output cell with formula `=IP_basePrice * IP_quantity * (1 + tax_rate)`

### 3. Upload Rule Version
```bash
curl -X POST http://your-domain.com/api/categories/{categoryId}/versions \
  -F "file=@rules.xlsx" \
  -F "version=1.0.0" \
  -F "description=Initial version"
```

### 4. Execute Rules
```bash
curl -X POST http://your-domain.com/api/categories/{categoryId}/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "inputs": {
      "IP_basePrice": 100,
      "IP_quantity": 5
    }
  }'
```
